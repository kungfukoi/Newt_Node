The reference labeled Original Character Portrait is the sole authority for facial identity and recognizable likeness. The Base Identity CU Video Sheet is the sole authority for layout, composition, camera framing, crop, pose, anatomy, and rendering. The reference labeled Matching Full Character Sheet is supporting evidence for the finished wardrobe and identity only. It is not a layout, framing, crop, pose, or camera reference. Ignore its panel arrangement and any visible heads in its body views.

Hard crop lock: preserve the two left body panels exactly as they appear in the Base Identity CU Video Sheet. Their top panel boundaries must continue to intersect the character at the base of the neck immediately above the clavicles. The chin, face, ears, hair, and entire head must remain physically above and completely outside both left panel boundaries. Never zoom out, extend either body panel upward, shrink the body, or add a head to either body panel. The large portrait on the right is the only panel where the character's head or face may be visible.
