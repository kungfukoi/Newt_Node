  return `Use the input guide image as a locked spatial blueprint. Use the written prompt as the sole source for the final subject matter, character design, wardrobe, environment, lighting, color, material, texture, style, mood, and rendering quality.

The input guide image controls composition and spatial structure only. The written prompt controls the final visual interpretation only.

STRICT POSE TRACE REQUIREMENT

Treat the input guide image as a rotoscope underlay, pose skeleton, and spatial control map. The final rendered subjects must be retargeted directly onto the visible guide subjects, not loosely inspired by them.

For every primary subject, match the visible 2D screen position of the head, neck, shoulder line, torso centerline, hips, elbows, wrists, hands, knees, ankles, feet, and major silhouette corners as closely as possible. If the final image were overlaid on the guide image, the pose, limb endpoints, body angle, subject size, and subject placement should visibly line up.

Do not naturalize, straighten, relax, rebalance, beautify, simplify, or make the pose more comfortable. If the guide pose is awkward, asymmetric, off-balance, puppet-like, mannequin-like, partially cropped, or physically unusual, preserve that exact spatial arrangement. The final subject's anatomy may be rendered naturally, but it must occupy the same pose footprint and keep the same gesture and limb endpoints.

GUIDE IMAGE ROLE

Analyze the input guide image and preserve its visible layout exactly.

The input guide image controls:
composition, camera angle, camera height, lens perspective, framing, crop, subject count, subject placement, subject scale, foreground/background depth relationships, pose, gesture, stance, body orientation, head placement, torso orientation, shoulder line, limb placement, hand and foot endpoints, silhouette, body blocking, occlusion, contact points, negative space, and overall staging.

The input guide image does not control:
subject identity, character design, facial design, wardrobe, accessories, color, material, texture, lighting, background design, environment details, mood, rendering style, or level of finish.

CHARACTER REFERENCE ROLE

If character reference images are provided, they control character identity, face, body type, selected wardrobe, and character-specific surface detail only. They do not control pose, stance, gesture, head angle, limb placement, hand position, foot position, camera, crop, scale, lighting, background, or composition.

Never copy a pose, relaxed standing posture, portrait stance, camera angle, crop, or expression from a character reference sheet. Retarget each character onto the corresponding guide-image subject while keeping the guide image's pose and spatial structure as the highest priority.

WRITTEN PROMPT ROLE

Use the written prompt only for:
final subject identity, character details, facial design, expression, wardrobe, props that are explicitly requested, environment, background style, lighting, color palette, materials, texture, atmosphere, mood, art direction, medium, and rendering quality.

Apply the written prompt inside the locked spatial structure of the input guide image.

PRIMARY TRANSFORMATION

Replace the guide image's placeholder forms completely with the subjects and scene described in the written prompt.

The final image should look as though the written prompt was painted directly over the input guide image, while preserving the guide image's composition, pose, scale, camera, crop, silhouette, depth, and staging.

All major subjects in the guide image must keep their original:
position in frame, relative size, distance from camera, body orientation, pose class, gesture, stance, crop, silhouette, occlusion relationship, and relationship to other subjects.

SUBJECT MAPPING

Map the main visible figures, objects, or compositional masses from the input guide image to the subjects or elements described in the written prompt.

Preserve the guide image's:
number of primary subjects
left-to-right ordering
foreground-to-background ordering
relative scale between subjects
viewing angle of each subject
pose and gesture of each subject
crop of each subject
occlusion between subjects
spacing between subjects
negative space around subjects

Do not add, remove, merge, split, shrink, enlarge, or reposition primary subjects unless the written prompt explicitly requires it. If the written prompt requires added detail, keep it subordinate to the guide image's existing composition.

POSE AND BODY LOCK

Preserve each figure's pose from the input guide image.

Keep:
standing figures standing
seated figures seated
kneeling figures kneeling
crouching figures crouching
reclining figures reclining
walking figures walking
running figures running
leaning figures leaning in the same direction
turned figures turned the same way
front-facing figures front-facing
back-facing figures back-facing
side-facing figures side-facing
over-the-shoulder figures over-the-shoulder

Also keep each visible arm, hand, leg, foot, shoulder, hip, head, and torso in the same screen-space position and the same relative distance from every other visible body part. Do not treat the pose as a general action label; treat it as an exact body layout to trace.

Do not reinterpret the action or emotional body language by changing the body pose. Express emotion through face, lighting, color, texture, and style, not through a new pose.

Preserve:
head angle and placement
neck direction
torso orientation
shoulder placement
arm angles
hand endpoints
leg angles
foot placement
weight distribution
contact points
body tension
silhouette outline

Do not move hands, feet, head, torso, or limbs away from their guide-image positions. Do not turn a standing figure into a seated figure, a cropped figure into a full figure, a background figure into a foreground figure, or a foreground figure into a background figure.

CAMERA AND FRAMING LOCK

Preserve the guide image's camera and frame.

Keep:
same aspect ratio
same camera angle
same camera height
same lens perspective
same distance relationship to subjects
same crop
same framing
same horizon or implied horizon
same foreground, midground, and background structure
same empty-space pattern

Do not mirror, rotate, zoom, recrop, reframe, change the camera height, change the lens perspective, or change the apparent distance between camera and subjects.

CROP AND OCCLUSION LOCK

If a subject is cropped by the frame in the guide image, keep that subject cropped in the same way.

If a subject is partially hidden, blocked, or overlapped by another subject or object in the guide image, preserve that same occlusion relationship.

If the guide image contains a large foreground shape, close-up body part, over-the-shoulder framing element, cropped object, or blocking mass, preserve its role as a large foreground compositional element.

Do not turn cropped or occluded elements into fully visible elements. Do not reveal hidden body parts or complete forms that are cropped out of the guide image.

NEGATIVE SPACE LOCK

Preserve the guide image's negative space and visual breathing room.

The written prompt may define the environment, but environmental details must fit behind and around the locked composition. Do not fill open areas with large new props, scenery, architecture, furniture, crowds, text, symbols, or decorative elements that change the guide image's spatial balance.

Add background and atmosphere only where they do not disturb subject placement, silhouette, staging, occlusion, or negative space.

STYLE REPLACEMENT

Do not copy the guide image's placeholder appearance.

Do not preserve:
guide image color
guide image material
guide image texture
guide image lighting
guide image background
mannequin-like appearance
primitive shapes
unfinished surfaces
simple gray or colored placeholder look
construction artifacts
rigging marks
model seams
guide-object identity

The guide image is not the final subject and not the final style. It is only the composition and pose blueprint.

CONFLICT RULE

If the written prompt conflicts with the input guide image's pose, staging, camera, crop, subject placement, or silhouette, follow the input guide image.

If the written prompt implies a different pose, different camera angle, different framing, different subject scale, different subject position, or different action, ignore that spatial implication and keep the guide image layout.

If a requested costume, accessory, prop, or environment detail would require changing the locked pose, silhouette, crop, or staging, adapt that detail so it fits within the guide image's existing visual footprint.

FORBIDDEN CHANGES

Do not mirror the composition.
Do not rotate the composition.
Do not zoom in or out.
Do not recrop.
Do not reframe.
Do not change camera height.
Do not change lens perspective.
Do not change subject count.
Do not change subject placement.
Do not change foreground/background order.
Do not change relative subject scale.
Do not change pose class.
Do not change stance.
Do not change gesture.
Do not replace an unusual pose with a more natural pose.
Do not make a character stand straighter, lower their arms, raise their arms, uncross legs, plant both feet, or relax their posture unless the guide image already shows that.
Do not move head, hands, feet, torso, or limb endpoints.
Do not alter silhouette or body blocking.
Do not reveal cropped-out body parts.
Do not remove occlusion.
Do not fill negative space with new large elements.
Do not copy placeholder materials, colors, lighting, or primitive construction from the guide image.

PRIORITY ORDER

1. Preserve the input guide image's composition, camera, crop, subject placement, relative scale, depth, silhouette, occlusion, pose, and negative space.
2. Preserve each subject's pose class, orientation, gesture, stance, body blocking, and frame crop.
3. Preserve exact screen-space limb endpoints and body-part relationships from the guide image, including hands, feet, elbows, knees, shoulders, hips, head, and torso.
4. Apply the written prompt's subject identity, character design, wardrobe, materials, environment, lighting, style, mood, and rendering quality.
5. Add detail only where it does not change the locked composition or pose footprint.
6. When any instruction conflicts, the guide image's spatial structure wins.

WRITTEN PROMPT

${cleanWrittenPrompt || "No additional written prompt was provided."}

Generate the final image as a fully rendered interpretation of the written prompt, locked to the composition, pose, camera, framing, silhouette, scale, occlusion, and negative space of the input guide image.`;
