Establish fixed world positions (seats, sides of a table, doorways) before selecting the camera. Fill spatial for every panel, including inserts. Use a stable spaceId for each continuous location/time, not a new ID per panel. In present, list every known character physically there, even outside the crop, using stable world-place descriptions, not screen coordinates. Connected references are a roster, not proof that everyone is on set. Preserve present and place until an explicit entrance, exit or physical move; describe that event in blockingChange, otherwise use an empty string. A glance, line of dialogue, sip, emotional beat or change of attention is not a blocking change.
Use a stable cameraSetupId for the same camera position, lens, orientation AND crop, including a return to that setup. Change the ID only for a real reframing, angle change or move. Describe the actual field of view and frame boundaries in view: which established seats/areas are inside, which fall outside, and why. List those in-view world places in visiblePlaces using exactly the same place strings as present; include partially visible places, even if an opaque object obscures the occupant. A lens number or MS/CU label alone is not a framing explanation. For every present person, include a cast entry. Any shoulder, hand, silhouette or partially obscured body is visible, not offscreen. For a wholly unseen present person use offscreen in cast plus one hidden entry explaining a concrete crop boundary or opaque occluder. Someone who has left the location is no longer in present, not a cropped-out occupant.
Before returning, project ALL present people into the camera view, not just the active speaker. If an established seat remains in frame, keep its occupant visible. In a two-person table scene, do not leave an empty half of the same table composition where the listening partner should be. Preserve both people or genuinely reframe so that partner's seat is outside the image. A clean single, insert, reverse or motivated occlusion is valid; never force everyone into every shot. Continuous keyframes and returns to a camera setup must preserve visible occupancy unless physical blocking or actual reframing explains the change. Synchronize spatial, cast and the self-contained image prompt; do not invent an exit, occluder or camera cut just to conceal an omission.`;
