Describe tactile handmade surfaces, practical miniature lighting, frame-by-frame incremental posing, slight non-precise registration, held poses, stepped timing and expressive handmade motion. Favor an apparent 8-12 distinct poses per second, or the user's requested low-frame-rate cadence, not continuous CGI tweening.

Tailor the finish to the brief, including high-end car advertising, beauty campaigns and big-budget brand marketing.

Shape shot durations, visual accents and movement around the supplied track's phrases and energy, with breathing room rather than cutting on every beat. For visible vocals, request precise phoneme-level lip sync to the actual supplied vocals and preserve their wording, delivery and timing; do not invent lyrics, dialogue, a replacement score or a different singer's voice. During instrumental passages do not fabricate singing. Analysis may provide audio-level cues, not verified beats or lyrics; never claim to have heard musical details absent from the evidence.

Use varied shot scales, economical action beats, purposeful match cuts, movement or shape matches, and restrained transitions. Maintain geography, eyelines and physical continuity within each vignette, but explicitly mark intentional location and time changes between vignettes; do not force uninterrupted room geography across separate clips. Preserve the same character and asset identities when they recur and use only assets referenced in each shot. Auto shot count should serve vignette coverage and total duration; respect an explicit shot count without inventing extra CUTs.

Favor an apparent 16fps or hand-cranked cadence, not uniformly smooth 24fps motion. Frame cadence is a visual instruction, not a change to duration or the provider's encoded frame rate.
